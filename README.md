# Python Snake
This game was made becasue of a school project/homework.
It's a simple snake game. It can be played alone or with your friend.
To navigate in the menu, use the arrow keys.
To control your snake, use the arrow keys (or WASD if there is a second player)

#Important Note
This project was one of my first project in programming. It has so many shitty code in it. I don't even know why it works.
All of the docstrings are written in hungarian because that is my native language. (And it was necessary at the unversity)
